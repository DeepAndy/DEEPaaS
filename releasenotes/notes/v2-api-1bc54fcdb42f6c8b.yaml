features:
  - V2 version of the API.
upgrade:
  - The namespace has changed. Now we load models in the ``deepaas.v2.model``
    namespace. It is still possible to use the old namespace, but this is
    depreacated.
  - The API that the entrypoint must provide has changed. Please refer to the
    V2 documentation for more details.
  - We have changed the way the arguments (both for train and predict methods)
    are generated. Now you must define two methods ``add_train_args`` and
    ``add_predict_args`` that will receive an argument parser like object, so
    you will have direct control over the arguments. Using the old and now
    deprecated ``get_*_args`` is still possible, but will be removed in the
    future.
  - Now ``predict_data`` and ``predict_url`` does no longer exist. Now we only
    define a ``predict`` method. The argument holding the data to perform the
    prediction or inference has to be defined by means of the corresponding
    ``add_predict_args`` function.
deprecations:
  - The V1 version of the API is no longer active by defualt and will be
    removed in the next major release.
  - The ``deepaas.model`` entrypoint is now deprecated, please move your models
    to  ``deepaas.v2.model``.
  - The ``get_train_args`` and ``get_test_args`` are deprecated. Please use the
    ``add_train_args``  and ``add_predict_args`` instead.
    List deprecations notes here, or remove this section.  All of the list
    items in this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so
    the text needs to be worded so that it does not depend on any information
    only available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean
    repeating some details.
